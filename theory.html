        <h1><b>Theory</b></h1>
        <p>Newton's Cradle is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy through a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward.</p>
        
        
        <h2><b>Mathematical equations</b></h2>
        <p>The fundamental principles behind Newton's Cradle involve the conservation of momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy. These principles can be expressed through the following equations:</p>
        
        <div class="formula">
            <strong>Conservation of Momentum:</strong><br>
            P=mv
        </div>
        
        <div class="formula">
            <strong>Conservation of Energy:</strong><br>
            K = ½mv²
        </div>
        
        <p><u>Where:</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li> m is the mass</li>
            <li>v is the velocity</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h2><b>Physics Behind Newton's Cradle</b></h2>
        <p>When the first ball is lifted and released, it gains kinetic energy due to gravity. Upon collision with the next ball, this energy is transferred through the balls, as each collision adheres to the conservation laws mentioned above. This results in the ball on the opposite end swinging upward with a similar velocity, demonstrating the energy transfer clearly.</p>

        <p>In an ideal Newton's Cradle, with perfectly elastic collisions and no energy loss, the balls would continue to swing indefinitely. However, in real-world applications, factors such as air resistance and internal friction gradually dissipate the energy, causing the motion to eventually cease.</p>

        <h1>Isaac Newton</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and author who is widely recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He made seminal contributions to many fields of science and mathematics, laying the foundations for classical mechanics.</p>
        
        <h2>Thoughts on Creating the Cradle</h2>
        <div class="quote">
            "To every action, there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts." - Isaac Newton
        </div>
        <p>Newton's Cradle, a device that demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy, embodies Newton's third law of motion. While the device itself was invented in 1967 by English actor Simon Prebble, its underlying principles are rooted in Newton's discoveries. The cradle visually demonstrates how momentum and energy are conserved in elastic collisions, a key concept in Newtonian physics.</p>
        
        <h2>Major Achievements</h2>
        <div class="achievement">
            <h3>Mathematics: Calculus</h3>
            <p>Newton, along with Leibniz, is credited with the development of calculus. His work in this area provided the tools necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the physical world.</p>

        <div class="achievement">
            <h3>Physics: Laws of Motion</h3>
            <p>Newton's three laws of motion laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and the body's motion in response to those forces.</p>

        <div class="achievement">
            <h3>Astronomy: Universal Gravitation</h3>
            <p>Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe, with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This groundbreaking work explained the motion of celestial bodies and was a monumental step in the field of astronomy.</p>

        <div class="achievement">
            <h3>Optics</h3>
            <p>Newton made significant contributions to the field of optics, including the discovery that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors. He demonstrated this through his famous experiments with prisms.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Newton's influence on science is immeasurable. His work laid the groundwork for countless advancements in physics, astronomy, and mathematics. Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation were not just theoretical; they had practical implications and helped shape our understanding of the physical universe. His methodologies and scientific rigor set the standard for future scientific inquiry.</p>

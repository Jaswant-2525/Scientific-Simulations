**Interactive Newton’s Cradle Simulation (Web-Based)**

An interactive, web-based simulation of **Newton’s Cradle** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to visually demonstrate the principles of **conservation of momentum** and **conservation of energy**. 

This project blends clean front-end development with core physics concepts, allowing users to experiment with different parameters and observe how they affect the motion of the cradle in real time.

**Project Overview**

Newton’s Cradle is a classic physics demonstration where a series of suspended spheres illustrate how momentum and energy are transferred through elastic collisions. 
In this project:
   The cradle is rendered in the browser using **HTML** and **CSS** and the motion and interactions between the balls are controlled using **JavaScript**.
   Users can adjust key parameters such as:
      -> Number of pendulums (balls)
      -> Impact speed / initial displacement

These controls allow users to explore how different configurations affect the behavior of the system.

**Key Features** 

**Interactive Controls**
  -> Change the number of pendulums in the cradle.
  -> Adjust the initial impact speed or angle to vary the intensity of collisions.
  -> Restart or reset the simulation to its default settings.

**Physics-Inspired Animation**
  -> Frame-by-frame CSS animations derived from the principles of **momentum** and **energy conservation**.
  -> Smooth and realistic motion of balls, visually imitating how a real Newton’s Cradle behaves.

**Clean UI**
  -> Simple, intuitive layout to focus on the motion and physics.
  -> Responsive design so the simulation works across different screen sizes.
  
**Technologies Stack** 

  **HTML5** – Structure of the cradle and control panel.
  
  **CSS3** – Styling and frame-by-frame animations of pendulum motion.
  
  **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Logic for user interaction and dynamic updates to the simulation parameters.

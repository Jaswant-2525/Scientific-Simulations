# Interactive Newton’s Cradle Simulation (Web-Based)

An interactive, web-based simulation of **Newton’s Cradle** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to visually demonstrate the principles of **conservation of momentum** and **conservation of energy**.

This project blends clean front-end development with core physics concepts, allowing users to experiment with different parameters and observe how they affect the motion of the cradle in real time.


## 🎯 Project Overview

Newton’s Cradle is a classic physics demonstration where a series of suspended spheres illustrate how momentum and energy are transferred through elastic collisions.

In this project:

- The cradle is rendered in the browser using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- The motion and interactions between the balls are controlled using **JavaScript**.
- Users can adjust key parameters such as:
  - Number of pendulums (balls)
  - Impact speed / initial displacement

These controls allow users to explore how different configurations affect the behavior of the system.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Interactive Controls**
  - Change the number of pendulums in the cradle.
  - Adjust the initial impact speed or angle to vary the intensity of collisions.
  - Restart or reset the simulation to its default settings.

- **Physics-Inspired Animation**
  - Frame-by-frame CSS animations derived from the principles of **momentum** and **energy conservation**.
  - Smooth and realistic motion of balls, visually imitating how a real Newton’s Cradle behaves.

- **Clean UI**
  - Simple, intuitive layout to focus on the motion and physics.
  - Responsive design so the simulation works across different screen sizes.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the cradle and control panel.
- **CSS3** – Styling and frame-by-frame animations of pendulum motion.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Logic for user interaction and dynamic updates to the simulation parameters.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/newtons-cradle-simulation.git
cd newtons-cradle-simulation

🕹️ **Usage**
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Use the control panel (sliders / input fields / buttons) to:
3. Set the number of balls in the cradle.
4. Adjust the initial impact speed or initial displacement.
5. Click Start / Play to run the simulation.
6. Observe how the motion changes with different settings.
7. Use Reset to return to the default configuration.

🧪** Physics Concepts Demonstrated**

**Conservation of Momentum**
When one ball strikes the others, momentum is transferred through the line of balls, causing the ball on the opposite end to swing out.

**Conservation of Energy**
The total mechanical energy (ignoring losses like air resistance and friction) is approximately conserved, which is visible in the nearly symmetric motion of the balls.

The animation approximates these principles to visually match real-world behavior.
